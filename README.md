# MNIST is a dataset containing handwritten images (28px by 28px) to be used for handwritten digit recognition using Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
I have used a 2-layer ANN for this purpose.
The dimensions of the layers are (784,256,10)
The main process is: Linear -> ReLU -> Linear -> Softmax
I got training set accuracy : 87%
I got test set accuracy : 89%
There are a few places for improvement such as :
1) Using more hidden layers
2) Preprocessing the training data
